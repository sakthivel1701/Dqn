# Dqn
Implementation of Dqn(Deep Queue Network) to the dataset 
A Deep Q-Network (DQN) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and processes involved in DQNs:

Core Concepts
Reinforcement Learning: An area of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

Q-Learning: A value-based reinforcement learning algorithm where the agent learns the value of taking a particular action in a particular state.

Deep Neural Networks: Used in DQNs to approximate the Q-function because traditional tabular Q-learning doesn't scale well to environments with large state or action spaces

Key Techniques
Replay Memory: Helps in stabilizing training by reducing the correlation between consecutive samples.
Target Network: A separate network used to compute the target Q-values, reducing the oscillations and divergence in the Q-values.
Epsilon-Greedy Policy: Balances exploration (choosing random actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known actions).
